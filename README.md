### Purpose
Predict author of a text message based solely on its content.

### Usage
Add a `data.json` file which consists of an object mapping author names to a list of their messages. e.g.

```json
{
	"alice": [
		"no",
		"no",
		"maybe"
	],
	"bob": [
		"Hi!",
		"How are you doing?",
		"Do you want to hang out tomorrow?",
		"Aww"
	],
	"charlie": [
		"howdy",
		"how are you doing"
	]
}
```
